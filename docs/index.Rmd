## Covid Report
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in so many ways. It has brought stress, sickness, and even death. Staying safe became a huge adjustment for most people as it meant wearing masks, staying in quarantine for months on end, and ordering our groceries to our homes. It was and still is a serious time. Today, the total number of US cases is `r get_total_cases()`. And, the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. Although spikes are plateauing and case numbers aren't as high, we still must get vaccinated, stay on top of our booster shots, and stay home if we are sick.


I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
